### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 I honestly really enjoyed because I got to learn how to create a simple BlackJack game. I've
    always been a fan of BlackJack and creating my own little iteration of the game was so amazing. I wish I
    could've fleshed out the game more and made it even better and more intricate!
