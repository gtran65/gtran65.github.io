### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 I honestly really enjoyed because I got to learn how to create a simple BlackJack game. I've
    always been a fan of BlackJack and creating my own little iteration of the game was so amazing. I wish I
    could've fleshed out the game more and made it even better and more intricate! I liked learning how to
    validate the arguments and adding up the total of the cards and seeing if they hit 21!

* Lab 5

    With Lab 5, I've always found myself yearning for a calculator that could do simple things like calculating
    the area of a rectangle during my earlier years in math classes. It's so facisnating that not only do I have
    one now, but that I built it myself. I also loved learning how important it is to compartmentalize files so
    the overall project can stay more organized, imagine if all the code was jumbled into one file!

* Lab 7

    I really enjoyed the challenge of Lab 7, not only that but it's practicalicaty in solving a realistic problem
    in the world. I know that the ability to automonus something as important as parking restrictions would be helpful
    to instutitions that need to enforce such restrictions, like Cal State Fullerton and their parking structures. More
    specific to computer science, this lab helped me learn how to utilize conditional pieces like while and if statements
    more effectively and for a realistic purpose.
